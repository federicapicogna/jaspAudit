Ground Truth Information
===

In the context of item classification, the term ground truth information refers to the true classification of items, obtained from reliable sources or domain experts. 

For example, imagine a bank wanting to decide whether to give a client a loan by classifying them as a good or bad credit risk. The bank could look at past data information showing whether clients repaid or defaulted on their loans, along with their characteristics. Whether the client actually repaid the loan is considered the ground truth. 

Similarly, imagine a company that wants to speed up its hiring process by using resumes to decide which candidates to interview. The company could look at past data from employees who were hired based on resume selections made by a human resources expert. These expert selections are considered the ground truth.
