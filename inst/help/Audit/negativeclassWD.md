Negative Class Well Defined 
===

The negative class of the classification variable can be considered well defined. For example, when classifying bank transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate, there are only two possible options. In this case, the negative class CAN simply refers to all legitimate transactions, without any need to analyze why a transaction is considered legitimate. This makes the negative well-defined and unimodal.
