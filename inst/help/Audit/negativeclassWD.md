Negative Class Well Defined 
===

The negative class of the classification variable can be considered well defined. For example, when classifying bank transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate, there are only two possible options. In this case, the negative class can simply refers to non-legitimate (i.e. fraudulent) transactions, without needing to analyze why a transaction is considered non-legitimate. This makes the negative well-defined and unimodal.
