Negative Class As Everything Not Positive
===

The negative class of the classification variable can be considered as everything that it is not positive. For example, when evaluating customer satisfaction for a service, customers can either be satisfied or dissatisfied. However, dissatisfaction can arise from various reasons (such as “not satisfied because of shipping delays”, “not satisfied because the product or its features are not working properly”, or “not satisfied because customer service is unhelpful”),  but all these reasons fall under the category of “not satisfied” and can be grouped together without any distinction.
